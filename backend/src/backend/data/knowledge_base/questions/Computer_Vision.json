      "question_text": "A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on a dataset of images. What is the primary purpose of the pooling layer in this architecture?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To increase the spatial dimensions of the feature maps\", \"B\": \"To reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps and downsample the image data\", \"C\": \"To increase the number of feature channels\", \"D\": \"To apply non-linear transformations to the feature maps\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "The pooling layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, effectively downsampling the image data. This helps reduce the dimensionality of the data and improves the network's ability to generalize."

      "question_text": "A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on a dataset of images with bounding boxes around objects. What is the primary purpose of using a Region Proposal Network (RPN) in this context?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To improve the accuracy of object detection by reducing false positives\", \"B\": \"To increase the speed of object detection by reducing the number of regions to process\", \"C\": \"To enable the network to learn features at multiple scales\", \"D\": \"None of the above\"}",
      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "The RPN is used to generate candidate regions for object detection, which are then passed through a classifier to determine their class and location. This helps to reduce false positives by focusing on high-quality proposals."
