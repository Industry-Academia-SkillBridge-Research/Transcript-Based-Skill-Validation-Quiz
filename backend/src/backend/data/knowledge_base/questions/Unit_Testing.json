      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "Unit tests check a small part of the code to ensure it behaves as expected. This helps catch bugs early and prevent them from propagating throughout the system."

      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "Unit tests focus on verifying that small, isolated pieces of code (units) behave as expected. This helps ensure that changes to the codebase do not introduce bugs."

      "question_text": "What is the primary purpose of a mock object in unit testing?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To test the integration between multiple units of code\", \"B\": \"To isolate dependencies and make individual units easier to test\", \"C\": \"To verify the correctness of a single unit of code in isolation\", \"D\": \"To reduce the number of test cases required for a given feature\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "A mock object is used to isolate dependencies and make individual units easier to test, allowing developers to focus on one unit at a time. This makes it easier to identify and fix issues in the code."

      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "Mocking libraries allow you to isolate dependencies, making your tests more reliable by controlling the inputs and outputs. This is particularly useful when testing complex interactions between multiple classes."
