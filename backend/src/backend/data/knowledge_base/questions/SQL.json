      "question_text": "What does the SQL keyword 'ASC' do in a SELECT statement?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"Sorts data in descending order\", \"B\": \"Sorts data in ascending order\", \"C\": \"Groups similar values together\", \"D\": \"Removes duplicate rows\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "The 'ASC' keyword sorts the result set in ascending order. This means that the smallest value will come first."

      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"It retrieves data from a database table.\", \"B\": \"It displays the execution plan of a query.\", \"C\": \"It modifies the schema of a database table.\", \"D\": \"It deletes data from a database table.\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "The 'EXPLAIN' command is used to analyze and display the execution plan of a SQL query, which shows how the database will execute the query. This can help optimize query performance by identifying potential bottlenecks."
