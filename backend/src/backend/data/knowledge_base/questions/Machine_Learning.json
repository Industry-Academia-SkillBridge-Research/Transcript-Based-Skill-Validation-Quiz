      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"Linear Regression\", \"B\": \"Decision Trees\", \"C\": \"Backpropagation and Forward Propagation\", \"D\": \"K-Means Clustering\"}",
      "correct_option": "C",
      "explanation": "Neural networks use backpropagation to adjust the model's weights during training, and forward propagation to make predictions. This process allows the network to learn from its mistakes and improve its accuracy."

      "question_text": "What does a decision tree in machine learning do?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"It's a type of neural network\", \"B\": \"It makes predictions based on features and their relationships\", \"C\": \"It's used for clustering data\", \"D\": \"It's a type of regression algorithm\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model to make predictions based on the features and their relationships. It works by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the most informative feature."

      "question_text": "What is the primary goal of feature scaling in machine learning?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To reduce the dimensionality of the data\", \"B\": \"To prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model\", \"C\": \"To improve the convergence rate of gradient descent algorithms\", \"D\": \"To increase the number of local minima in the loss function\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "Feature scaling is used to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model, which can lead to biased results. This is particularly important when using distance-based algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors or support vector machines."

      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "Regularization is used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which helps to reduce the model's capacity and improve its generalizability."

      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generate new data samples, whereas Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct existing data. This is the primary difference between the two architectures."
