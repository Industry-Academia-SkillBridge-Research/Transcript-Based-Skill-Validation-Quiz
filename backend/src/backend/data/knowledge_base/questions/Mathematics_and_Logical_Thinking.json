      "question_text": "What is the result of 2^3 in binary?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"1000\", \"B\": \"1010\", \"C\": \"1100\", \"D\": \"1110\"}",
      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "In binary, 2^3 is equal to 8, which is represented as 1000. This is because each digit in the binary representation represents a power of 2."

      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"1\", \"B\": \"0\", \"C\": \"x\", \"D\": \"\\u00acx\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "In Boolean Algebra, the expression x ∧ (¬x) is a conjunction of x and its negation. This will always result in 0, as there can be no overlap between an element and its complement."

      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "In Boolean Algebra, the result of x AND NOT y is simply x AND y because the NOT operation has no effect on the AND operation."

      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "In Boolean Algebra, XOR (exclusive or) operation returns 1 if the operands are different. In this case, 2 and 3 are different."

      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"3\", \"B\": \"4\", \"C\": \"5\", \"D\": \"6\"}",
      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "To find the value of x, we need to isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2. This gives us x = 3."

      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "The expression (A ∧ B) ∨ A simplifies to (A ∧ B) ∨ A, which is equivalent to A ∨ B. However, since A is already present in the expression, we can simplify it further by removing the redundant term."

      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is the result of applying the distributive law to the given expression. The expression can be simplified by distributing the OR operation over the AND operation."

      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "The derivative of f(x) at x=1 is found by substituting x=1 into the derivative function, which gives f'(1) = 2(1) + 3 = 5. The correct answer is option A."

      "correct_option": "C",
      "explanation": "To find f'(1), we need to differentiate the function f(x) with respect to x and then evaluate it at x=1. The derivative of f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4 is f'(x) = 2x + 3, so f'(1) = 2(1) + 3 = 5."

      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "The expression A ∧ (A ∨ B) simplifies to A, because the OR operation with A results in A, and then ANDing it with itself doesn't change its value."

      "correct_option": "C",
      "explanation": "The expression (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ ¬B) simplifies to A, because the result of both sub-expressions is A. This is due to the properties of conjunction and disjunction in Boolean algebra."
