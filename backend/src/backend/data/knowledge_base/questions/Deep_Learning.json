      "question_text": "What is the primary function of a batch normalization layer in a deep neural network?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To reduce overfitting by normalizing the input data to have zero mean and unit variance.\", \"B\": \"To speed up training by reducing the number of parameters in the model.\", \"C\": \"To improve the interpretability of the model by providing feature importance scores.\", \"D\": \"To increase the capacity of the model by allowing it to learn more complex patterns.\"}",
      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "Batch normalization helps reduce internal covariate shift, which can lead to overfitting. By normalizing the input data, batch normalization allows the model to focus on learning the underlying patterns rather than being distracted by large input values."
