      "question_text": "A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) is monitoring a network and detects a suspicious packet. What should be the next step?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"Block the IP address of the source of the packet\", \"B\": \"Alert the security team to investigate further\", \"C\": \"Allow the packet to pass through the network\", \"D\": \"Disconnect the entire network\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "The next step should be to alert the security team to investigate further, as blocking or disconnecting the network could cause unnecessary downtime and disconnection of legitimate traffic. Investigating further will help determine if it's a false positive or an actual threat."
