      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "Encapsulation is used to hide sensitive data and limit access to it through controlled methods, ensuring that internal implementation details are not exposed to external classes. This helps prevent data corruption or misuse."

      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"It allows for more efficient memory usage by reducing the number of objects created.\", \"B\": \"It enables developers to focus on essential features and hide implementation details.\", \"C\": \"It improves code readability by providing a simplified interface to complex functionality.\", \"D\": \"It facilitates the use of inheritance by allowing for more derived classes.\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
