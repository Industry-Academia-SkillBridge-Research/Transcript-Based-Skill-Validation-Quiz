      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "Encapsulation is used to hide the internal implementation details of an object from its external interfaces, promoting data hiding and abstraction."

      "correct_option": "C",
      "explanation": "Encapsulation reduces coupling by hiding internal implementation details, making it easier to modify or replace individual components without affecting other parts of the system."

      "question_text": "What is the primary purpose of an abstract class in C++?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To provide a common interface for related classes\", \"B\": \"To declare a class that cannot be instantiated directly\", \"C\": \"To define a class with both data and methods\", \"D\": \"To inherit properties from a base class\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "An abstract class in C++ is declared as 'abstract' using the 'abstract' keyword, which prevents it from being instantiated directly. This allows for inheritance of its properties and methods by other classes."

      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "Abstract classes in C++ provide a common interface for related classes, allowing for polymorphism and facilitating code reuse through inheritance."
