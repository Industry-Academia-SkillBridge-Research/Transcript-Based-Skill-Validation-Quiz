      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "UML stands for Unified Modeling Language, which is a standardized language used to create diagrams and models of software systems. It provides a common notation for visualizing and documenting the structure and behavior of complex systems."

      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "A Use Case in UML is used to describe the interactions between the system and its users, highlighting the functional requirements of the system. This helps developers understand how the system will be used by its end-users."

      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "An Abstract Class is used to represent a class that cannot be instantiated directly, and serves as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from. It provides a way to define common attributes and methods that can be shared among related classes."
