      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "The @Test annotation in JUnit is used to mark a method as a test case. This allows the JUnit framework to identify and run the method as part of a test suite."

      "explanation": "The @Before annotation is used to indicate that the annotated method should be executed before each test case. This allows you to set up any necessary state or resources for your tests."

      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "The @AfterEach annotation is used to specify methods that should be executed after each test case. This allows for setup and teardown code to be run consistently across all test cases."

      "correct_option": "C",
      "explanation": "The @BeforeClass annotation is used to indicate that a method should be executed only once, before all test cases in a class. This is useful for setting up shared resources or performing initialization tasks."
