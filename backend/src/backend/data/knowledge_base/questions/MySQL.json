      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "The PRIMARY KEY constraint ensures that each value in the specified column or set of columns is unique, preventing duplicate entries. This helps maintain data consistency and integrity within the database."

      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"It increments the primary key value automatically for each new row inserted.\", \"B\": \"It creates a unique identifier for each row.\", \"C\": \"It enables foreign key constraints.\", \"D\": \"It optimizes query performance.\"}",
      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "The AUTO_INCREMENT keyword is used to automatically increment the value of an integer column, typically used as a primary key. This ensures that each new row inserted has a unique identifier."

      "question_text": "What is the purpose of the PRIMARY KEY constraint in a MySQL table?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To enforce uniqueness on a column or set of columns.\", \"B\": \"To create an index on a column or set of columns.\", \"C\": \"To specify the default value for a column.\", \"D\": \"To enable transactions in a database.\"}",

      "question_text": "What is the purpose of the FOREIGN KEY constraint in a MySQL database?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To enforce referential integrity between tables.\", \"B\": \"To improve query performance by reducing the number of joins required.\", \"C\": \"To increase storage capacity by allowing duplicate values in a column.\", \"D\": \"To enable transactions and locking mechanisms.\"}",
      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to ensure that data in one table matches the data in another table, maintaining referential integrity. This helps prevent orphaned records and ensures data consistency across related tables."
