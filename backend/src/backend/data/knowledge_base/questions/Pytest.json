      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"It runs the fixture once per test session, but not between tests.\", \"B\": \"It runs the fixture before each test, regardless of the test session.\", \"C\": \"It runs the fixture only once for all tests in a session, and shares the result across tests.\", \"D\": \"It does nothing, fixtures are always run per-test.\"}",
      "correct_option": "C",
      "explanation": "The @pytest.fixture scope parameter 'session' allows you to share data between multiple tests within a test session. This is useful for setting up complex resources that can be reused across multiple tests."
