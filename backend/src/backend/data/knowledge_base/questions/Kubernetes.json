      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "A Kubernetes Deployment automates the rollout and rollback of application versions, ensuring that the desired state is maintained. It does this by managing replica sets, which in turn manage pods."

      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To manage persistent storage for applications\", \"B\": \"To automate rollouts and rollbacks of application code\", \"C\": \"To provide load balancing for services\", \"D\": \"To configure network policies\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "Deployments in Kubernetes are used to automate the rollout of new versions of an application, as well as roll back to a previous version if needed. This makes it easier to manage and maintain complex applications."

      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "A Kubernetes Deployment is responsible for managing the lifecycle of a Pod, including scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing. This ensures that applications are always available and running as expected."

      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To manage and orchestrate stateless applications\", \"B\": \"To deploy and manage pods across multiple nodes in an cluster\", \"C\": \"To provide persistent storage for stateful applications\", \"D\": \"To ensure that a specified number of replicas are running at any given time\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "A DaemonSet is used to deploy and manage pods across multiple nodes in a cluster, ensuring that the desired number of replicas are always running. This is particularly useful for applications that require a persistent presence on each node."

      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To manage and scale stateless applications\", \"B\": \"To run a single copy of a container on each node in a cluster\", \"C\": \"To deploy and manage a group of pods across multiple nodes\", \"D\": \"To create a self-healing service for a stateful application\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "A DaemonSet is used to run a single copy of a container on each node in a cluster, making it ideal for running system services or daemons. This ensures that the container is always running and can be easily managed across multiple nodes."
