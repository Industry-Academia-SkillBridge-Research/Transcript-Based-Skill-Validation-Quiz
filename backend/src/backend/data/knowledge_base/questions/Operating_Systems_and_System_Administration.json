      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "When a process attempts to access memory that is not mapped in its virtual address space, the operating system will terminate the process due to a segmentation fault. This is because the process has attempted to access memory that it does not have permission to access."

      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "When an I/O operation completes, the process that was blocked waiting for it becomes unblocked and continues execution. This is because the I/O completion signal allows the process to resume its execution."

      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"sched_yield()\", \"B\": \"pause()\", \"C\": \"sigpause()\", \"D\": \"nanosleep()\"}",
      "correct_option": "A",

      "correct_option": "C",
      "explanation": "A page fault exception is triggered when a process attempts to access memory that is not mapped. This allows the kernel to handle the situation, either by terminating the process or by allocating new physical pages for the requested memory region."

      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "When a process requests more memory than available in physical RAM, the operating system uses a combination of disk storage and swap space (also known as virtual memory) to satisfy the request. This allows the process to continue executing while the excess memory is allocated from disk storage."

      "correct_option": "C",
      "explanation": "When a process is swapped out of physical memory, its virtual memory is reclaimed by the kernel, which writes the process's state to disk. This allows other processes to use the freed-up physical memory."
