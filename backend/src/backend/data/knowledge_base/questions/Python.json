      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "The 'is' keyword in Python is used for identity comparison, checking if both variables point to the same object in memory. This is different from the '==' operator which checks for equality of values."

      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "The 'is' keyword in Python checks if two variables point to the same object in memory, not just if their values are equal. This is different from the '==' operator which checks for value equality."

      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"It opens and closes the file automatically.\", \"B\": \"It reads the entire file into memory.\", \"C\": \"It writes to the file without overwriting any existing data.\", \"D\": \"It deletes the file permanently.\"}",
      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "The 'with' keyword in Python is used with a context manager, which ensures that resources such as files are properly cleaned up after use. This includes opening and closing the file automatically, preventing resource leaks."

      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"It is used for exception handling.\", \"B\": \"It is used to open and close files.\", \"C\": \"It is used to create a context manager.\", \"D\": \"It is used to import modules.\"}",
      "correct_option": "C",
      "explanation": "The 'with' statement in Python is used to create a context manager, which automatically takes care of resources such as file handles or locks. This ensures that the resource is properly cleaned up after use, even if an exception occurs."

      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To create a new instance of a class\", \"B\": \"To register a subclass with its parent class\", \"C\": \"To override a method from the parent class\", \"D\": \"To add a new attribute to an existing class\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "The `__init_subclass__` method is used by classes to register their subclasses and perform any necessary setup or initialization. This allows the parent class to keep track of its subclasses and provide them with additional functionality."
