      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"It deletes all documents from the collection, but not the collection itself.\", \"B\": \"It drops the entire database, including all collections and data.\", \"C\": \"It removes the collection from the database, along with all its documents.\", \"D\": \"It creates a new collection with the same name as the original one.\"}",
      "correct_option": "A",
      "explanation": "The `drop()` command only deletes the documents in the specified collection, leaving the collection itself intact. This is useful for cleaning up data without affecting other collections or the database structure."
