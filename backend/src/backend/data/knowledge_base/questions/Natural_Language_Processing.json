      "question_text": "A neural network designed for NLP tasks typically consists of multiple layers, including an embedding layer, a transformer encoder, and a decoder. However, what is the primary function of the attention mechanism in this architecture?",
      "options_json": "{\"A\": \"To reduce the dimensionality of the input data\", \"B\": \"To weigh the importance of different input features when generating output\", \"C\": \"To introduce randomness into the model's weights during training\", \"D\": \"To handle out-of-vocabulary words\"}",
      "correct_option": "B",
      "explanation": "The attention mechanism in a transformer encoder weighs the importance of different input features when generating output, allowing the model to focus on relevant information. This is particularly useful for tasks like machine translation and text summarization."
